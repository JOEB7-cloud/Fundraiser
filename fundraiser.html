         On 07 Aug 2025, Ustav was involved in a terrible fire accident that left him with severe burns. After being rushed to the hospital, he underwent emergency surgery and will require many more in the coming weeks and months. The road to recovery will be long and difficult, with the added burden of overwhelming medical costs.

We’re raising funds to help cover the extensive medical expenses for Ustav, including surgeries, skin grafts, and rehabilitation. Please consider contributing to his recovery – every donation helps and will bring us one step closer to bringing Ustav back to full health.

Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, and your support during this incredibly difficult time. We are deeply grateful to everyone who has already donated and shared this campaign. Together, we can give Ustav the strength to overcome this tragedy.

🙏 We humbly request your support — please donate and share this message.
